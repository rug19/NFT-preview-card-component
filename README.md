## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
  
### What I learned

I learned to do a better HTML structure to facilitate the part of sterilization using CSS, which helps to have a better understanding of what is going on in my code. I also used effects like hover in this project that I didn't know how it uses, which was good because I had to look for information to learn something new.  


### Useful resources

- [fedmentor](https://fedmentor.dev/) - Thi is helped me a lot with my HTML structure. 
- [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is an amazing website about programming. I'd recommend it to anyone that started to learn to program and need to research things during the process of learning.
